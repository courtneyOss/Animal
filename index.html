          The first type of Opossum-like creature appeared on the continent about 65 million years ago. Marsupials migrated between North and South America back and forth until the continents separated. North American marsupials went extinct during the early Miocene, approx. 20 million years ago. But after the Isthmus of Panama emerged to reconnect North and South America, the Virginia opossum and the southern opossum made it back to North America. These mammals are wild and often spotted in the North American South and Midwest.</p>

          The preferred habitat for an opossum is a heavily wooded area near a body of water. However, opossum are adaptable and have been found in more urban settings getting along well. They do not build their own shelters, and rely on abandoned nests and dens initially made by other animals. They provide natural pest control service due to the amount of ticks they can consume. They also eat other small insects and animals as well as vegetation.</p>

          The opossum is known for being docile, they typically will not act out aggressively towards humans or animals that are bigger than it without serious provocation. Their normal defense mechanism is to intimidate predators by hissing, growling, burping, defecating, or running away. In high stress situations, they will faint and appear deceased. This is the behavior they are most known for, and the phrase “playing possum” is used to describe when something pretends to be dead. This behavior is taken a step beyond simply acting when it comes to the opossum. Their bodies will even go as far as to release a foul odor to really deter predators.</p>

          A majority of the modern opossum population are wild. There are a few occasions of domestication of opossum, but it is not a common thing to do. It is not recommended that opossum be kept as pets. Even though they are not particularly dangerous or aggressive, they are still wild animals and do not form bonds with humans like dogs or cats do.  The wild population is considered to be “vermin”, which are troublesome animals that clash with people within their habitats. They are known to get hit by cars often, dig in garbages, and find shelter in people’s property. Some hunters will hunt opossum for meat and fur, but they are not popular game animal for many.</p></div>
